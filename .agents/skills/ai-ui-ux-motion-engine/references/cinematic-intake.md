# Cinematic intake and stop rules

Use this gate before page implementation whenever the requested impact depends
on photographic camera movement, product transformation, burst/exploded motion
or scroll-controlled film.

## Ask only what is missing

1. **Target:** Which page areas need a flagship sequence, a supporting shot or
   code-native motion?
2. **Reference:** What should the visitor see happen? Use an attached example,
   storyboard or short scene list. For a video, inspect keyframes, transcript,
   prompt pack and description links rather than relying on a summary.
3. **Truth mode:** May the media be illustrative, must one concept identity stay
   stable, or must every visible product detail be evidence-accurate?
4. **Source:** Which photographs, approved keyframes, CAD renders or existing
   clips are authoritative?
5. **Provider:** Is a capable image/video provider connected and signed in?
6. **Authority:** What credit cap and maximum attempts are approved? Has the
   user authorised uploads and provider terms?
7. **Delivery:** Which browsers/devices matter, and is a static mobile or
   reduced-motion fallback acceptable?

Do not burden the user with implementation choices that the skill can make.

## Immediate response contract

If provider access, source assets or authority are missing, say:

> The requested effect needs pre-rendered cinematic motion; CSS alone cannot
> produce the changing camera view or product mechanics. I need the accuracy
> level, source references, required scenes/placements, media-provider access
> and a credit cap. I will first make one private proof and will not alter the
> page or substitute basic image reveals until it passes.

Continue independently when these answers already exist.

Keep the request to five decisions: accuracy target, source readiness,
provider/spend authority, desired placements and delivery/time budget. Do not
ask the user to choose implementation mechanics.

“First time” means the correct media route, questions, proof and stop rules are
used from the beginning. Generated video remains probabilistic.

## Accuracy-first routing

Use the fastest route that can meet the stated accuracy. For real products with
authoritative sources, default to evidence-accurate. Never substitute an
illustrative spectacular result silently. State before generation when exact
mechanics require CAD, compositing or real footage.

Use these target timeboxes:

- 15–30 minutes: private proof with ready sources and provider;
- 30–60 minutes: approved flagship plus scroll delivery;
- 5–10 minutes: derivative or supporting integration;
- 75–120 minutes: only for new/inconsistent sources, evidence-critical
  mechanics, CAD or compositing.

If a target is exceeded, report why and obtain approval before continuing.

## Three production tiers

### Flagship

- Use for the homepage or a key product-family journey.
- Usually 10–15 seconds with an authored beginning, progression and payoff.
- Treat full-screen, homepage, signature, intricate, burst, exploded and
  immersive scroll requests as flagship. Do not downgrade them to supporting
  merely because only one source image or a cheaper model is available.
- Use a provider/model that supports the necessary reference count, duration
  and multi-shot control.
- Allow one paid attempt and at most one explicitly approved retry.
- Reuse chapters of one approved film before generating more flagship films.

### Supporting cinematic shot

- Use for macros, controlled camera pushes, cooling, connector detail,
  power-on or one mechanically simple action.
- Keep one action, one camera instruction and one or two consistent references.
- Usually 3–5 seconds.
- Use lower-cost or unlimited generation only when its result passes QC.

### Code-native motion

- Use CSS, SVG, canvas or an existing motion library for diagrams, airflow,
  data paths, masks, typography and interface transitions.
- Do not spend generation credits when photographic state change is unnecessary.

## Truth-mode routing

### Illustrative

Permit creative transformation but still reject visible defects, unwanted text
and incoherent motion.

### Identity-locked

Use one identity-authority frame and keep proportions, material, lighting and
recognisable features stable. Reject identity drift.

### Evidence-accurate

Record immutable counts, geometry, labels, ports and permitted mechanical axes.
Use consistent photography, CAD or approved keyframes. If the generator cannot
hold these details after the approved attempts, simplify the motion or route to
CAD/compositing/real footage. Never prompt harder indefinitely.

## Proof-before-page rule

The first deliverable is:

1. the validated cinematic brief with the user's intent, progression, payoff,
   source coverage and prohibited substitutes recorded;
2. the prepared reference pack;
3. one generated proof;
4. automated technical checks, an overview contact sheet and risk-led dense QC;
5. an isolated scroll prototype with poster and reduced-motion fallback.

Run the semantic brief regression gate before upload or spend:

```bash
node scripts/validate-cinematic-brief.mjs cinematic-brief.json --check-files
```

After generation, run `validate-creative-acceptance.mjs --stage review`.
Technical media validation is a separate gate and cannot prove creative
success.

Do not redesign, publish or populate multiple routes until the user approves
that proof.

## Rejection and stop rules

Reject without trying to hide:

- changing product identity, count, spacing, ports or labels;
- rotating, bending, merging, duplicating or disappearing rigid parts;
- implausible insertion axes or clipping;
- texture crawl, false seams, invented branding or unreadable pseudo-text;
- a camera move that replaces the requested product story;
- a clip too short or slight to fulfil its assigned chapter;
- a collection of unrelated shots presented as one continuous journey;
- visible scrub jitter or incorrect reverse/forward mapping.

After the attempt cap, report the evidence and recommend one bounded change:
simpler action, better references, stronger model, CAD/compositing/filming, or
an explicitly illustrative concept.
